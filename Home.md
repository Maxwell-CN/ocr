# Tesseract at UB Mannheim

The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform OCR
of historical German newspapers ([Allgemeine Preu√üische Staatszeitung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allgemeine_Preu%C3%9Fische_Staatszeitung), [Deutscher Reichsanzeiger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Reichsanzeiger)).

Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for
a Windows version. That's why we have built a Tesseract installer for Windows.

The latest installer can be downloaded here:
[tesseract-ocr-setup-3.05.01.exe](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-3.05.01.exe) and [tesseract-ocr-setup-4.00.00dev.exe](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-4.00.00dev.exe) (experimental). There are also [older versions](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/) available.

In addition, we also provide [documentation](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/doc/) which was generated by Doxygen.

Hint: Old versions of the installer had an option to add Tesseract to the PATH environment variable. That option was disabled by default. If it was enabled and PATH was very long, it could happen that the new PATH was empty. We suggest not to use that option and disabled it in our latest version.
