#Tesseract at UB Mannheim

The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform OCR
of a historical newspaper (Deutscher Reichsanzeiger).

Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for
a Windows version. That's why we have built a Tesseract installer for Windows.
